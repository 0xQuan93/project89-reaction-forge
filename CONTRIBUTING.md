## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18 or higher
- **Package Manager**: npm (v9+)
- **Git**

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Fork the Repository**
    Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the GitHub page.

2.  **Clone Your Fork**
    ```bash

    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**

## 🧩 How to Contribute

### 1. 🐛 Reporting Bugs
Found a glitch? Please open an [Issue](https://github.com/0xQuan93/project89-reaction-forge/issues) with:
- A clear title.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Browser/Device details.
- Screenshots or console errors if possible.

### 2. ✨ Submitting Features
1.  Check the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) to see what's planned.
2.  Open an Issue to discuss your idea *before* writing code (saves you time!).
3.  Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-cool-feature`.
4.  Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add cool feature"`.
5.  Push to your fork and submit a **Pull Request**.

### 3. 🎨 Visual & UX Improvements
We value polish. If you see a misaligned pixel, a confusing button, or a way to make an animation smoother, fix it!

## 📏 Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**: We use strict typing. Avoid `any` whenever possible.
- **Components**: Functional React components with Hooks.
- **Styling**: Pure CSS modules or standard CSS (we are migrating to a cleaner structure).
- **Three.js**: Keep 3D logic separate from UI logic where possible (use the Managers pattern).
