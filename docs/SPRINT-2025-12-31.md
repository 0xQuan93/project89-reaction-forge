## ⚡ High Priority List (Strategy Pivot)
Priorities shifted following synchronization with Jake. Focus is now on monetization gating and database readiness.

1. **Monetization & IP Gating Architecture**
   - [ ] **JSON Export Gating:** Implement logic to token-gate or sub-gate pose exports.
   - [ ] **IP Ownership Model:**
     - **Standard (Free):** User creates pose ➡️ Auto-upload to Marketplace (Platform Asset).
     - **Premium (Token/Sub):** User spends Token/Sub ➡️ Retain IP ➡️ Option to sell on personal **Creator Page** or list on Marketplace manually.
2. **Database Implementation**
   - [ ] **Timeline:** ~2 days for creation and setup (Jake).
   - [ ] **Requirements:** Schema must support User Profiles, Creator Pages, Pose Ownership/IP Status, Token Balances, and Marketplace Listings.
3. **Market Value Focus**
   - [ ] **Core Question:** "What makes the most sense for people to pay for?"
   - [ ] **Action:** Prioritize features that drive immediate value and conversion.
   - [ ] **Speed:** Optimize for the fastest route to a deployable, monetizable product.
