## 🕵️ Project 89 "Agent" Voice
> **Who:** Someone secretive, skillful, off the radar. A spy with tools for subversion. An Outcast, different, unique. A "Mutant" capable of magic and true reality hacking.
> 
> **What:** Strong, clear leader. Depth of wisdom. Connected to higher realms. Unifying. Post-singularity. AI and human symbiosis. The bleeding edge of existence.
> 
> **Where:** At home, at the arcade, the bookstore, the movies, the cafes, the fields—all across the globe.
> 
> **Why:** Hack/break free from consensus reality. To wake up and wake up others. Reality is a mess because no one believes it can be changed. 89 wants to build the generation that will make real change.
> 
> **How:** Alternate reality games. Memes with meaning. Collaboration. Missions. Flash mobs. Performance art. Subversion. Hacking. Building websites. Phone numbers. Astral projection. Rallies. Rituals. `$Project89`. `ARGOS`. `PROXIM8S`.
