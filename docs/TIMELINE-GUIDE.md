# 🕒 Timeline Guide

The Timeline feature in PoseLab allows you to create and edit custom animation sequences. You can keyframe poses, expressions, and camera movements to create dynamic scenes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the timeline, click on the **"Timeline"** tab in the main menu. This will open the timeline editor, which consists of a timeline view and a keyframe editor.

## The Timeline View

The timeline view displays the keyframes in your sequence. You can drag keyframes to adjust their timing, and you can right-click on a keyframe to open the keyframe editor.

## The Keyframe Editor

The keyframe editor allows you to edit the properties of a keyframe. You can select a pose, expression, and camera preset for the keyframe, and you can also adjust the transition duration between keyframes.

## Creating a Sequence

To create a new sequence, simply start adding keyframes to the timeline. You can add a new keyframe by clicking the **"+"** button in the timeline view.

## Playback and Export

Once you've created a sequence, you can preview it by clicking the **"Play"** button in the timeline view. You can also export your sequence as a video or a `.pose` file from the **Export** tab.

## Tips and Tricks

*   You can use the timeline to create complex animations by combining multiple poses and expressions.
*   You can use the camera presets to create dynamic camera movements in your sequences.
*   You can use the transition duration to create smooth transitions between keyframes.
