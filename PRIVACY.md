# 🔒 Privacy & Data Sovereignty

**PoseLab** is designed with a "Local-First" architecture. We believe your digital avatar is an extension of your identity, and its data should remain under your control.

## 1. Local Processing
*   **No Uploads:** When you load a VRM file, it is processed entirely within your browser's memory. Your avatar file is **never** uploaded to our servers or any cloud storage.
*   **Local Storage:** Custom poses and application settings are saved to your browser's `localStorage` (or IndexedDB). This data stays on your device.

## 2. AI Features (Gemini)
*   **Optional:** The AI Pose Generation feature is optional.
*   **Data Transmission:** If you use the AI feature, only the *text prompt* you type (e.g., "ninja kick") is sent to Google's Gemini API.
*   **No Avatar Data:** Your VRM model, its blendshapes, and its mesh data are **never** sent to the AI. The AI returns generic pose data (bone rotations) which is then applied locally to your avatar.

## 3. Analytics
*   We use minimal, anonymous usage tracking (if applicable) to improve the software. We do not track personal identities or avatar specifics.

## 4. Your IP
*   **Your Avatar:** You retain full rights to the VRM files you use.
*   **Your Poses:** The animations and poses you create are yours. You are free to export, share, and sell them (subject to the license of the original avatar model you used, if applicable).

## 5. Community & Trust
As part of the **Iris Network** initiative, we are committed to transparency. This tool is a "resistance asset" meant to empower creators, not extract data from them.
